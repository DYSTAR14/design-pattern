S :- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
	Def : A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.
	Ex: A class should have single responsibility like impl class or save/repos class
	The SRP aims to separate concerns within a program. If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to change and maintain. Changes to one responsibility might affect the other responsibilities.


```
// Before applying SRP
class Employee {
    public void calculatePay() {
        // Calculate pay logic
    }

    public void save() {
        // Save employee to database logic
    }
}

// After applying SRP
class Employee {
    public void calculatePay() {
        // Calculate pay logic
    }
}

class EmployeeRepository {
    public void save(Employee employee) {
        // Save employee to database logic
    }
}
```
